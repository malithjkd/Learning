## Note on compressing images

This section explains the differences between ANTIALIAS and LANCZOS resampling algorithms used in image resizing with Python's Pillow library. Understanding these filters helps you choose the right one for your specific needs.

### ANTIALIAS

**Purpose**
* Provides a good balance of sharpness and smoothness for most image resizing tasks.

**Characteristics**
* Uses a triangular filter kernel for resampling.
* Reduces aliasing artifacts (jagged edges or color banding).
* Offers visually pleasing results without excessive blurring.

### LANCZOS

**Purpose** 
* Offers the highest quality resampling among common filters, excelling in preserving fine details and reducing artifacts.

**Characteristics**
* Uses a sinc-based filter kernel with a wider support than other filters.
* Provides superior image quality, especially for high-resolution images or critical applications.
* Can be computationally more expensive than other filters, especially for large images.

| Feature | ANTIALIAS | LANCZOS |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Quality | Good      | Best    |
| Speed   | Faster    | Slower  |
| Artifacts | Reduced | Minimized |
| Detail Preservation | Moderate  | Excellent |


### Choosing the Right Filter

General-purpose resizing: Use ANTIALIAS as a starting point.
High-quality resizing, especially for large images: Use LANCZOS for superior results.
Performance-critical applications: Consider ANTIALIAS or other faster filters if resources are limited.
